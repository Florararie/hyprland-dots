# hyprland-dots

This is mainly for my own personal use and archival. I'm not too particularly inclined to include a setup script either.  

These dots were made on CachyOS after already having previously installed KDE Plasma. As such I dont know what every dependency would be. Maybe I'll make something more comprehensive, but for now this is pretty much all I'm putting here. Feel free to use if you'd like.
